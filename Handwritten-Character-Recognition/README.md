# Handwritten Character Recognition - CodeAlpha Internship Task

## 📌 Objective
This project was developed during my one-month internship at CodeAlpha. The goal is to create a neural network that can accurately recognize handwritten characters, similar to the MNIST digit recognition task.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Preprocessing and normalization of image data
- Built a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras
- Used `ParameterGrid` to test various configurations of:
  - Hidden layer sizes
  - Learning rates
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification metrics
- Visualized model predictions

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization

## 📁 Files
- `codealpha-task-3.ipynb` – Full notebook with model training and results
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebook and run all cells
