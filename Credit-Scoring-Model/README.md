# Credit Scoring Model - CodeAlpha Internship Task 1

## 📌 Objective
This project is part of my one-month remote internship at CodeAlpha. The goal of this notebook is to build a machine learning model to predict **Credit Score** categories based on customer attributes using historical financial data.

## 🚀 What’s Inside
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Handling imbalanced classes using SMOTE
- Model training using `CatBoostClassifier` with hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV`
- Evaluation with classification report and accuracy metrics
- Visualization of model performance

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- CatBoost
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
