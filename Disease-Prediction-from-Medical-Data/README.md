# Disease Prediction from Medical Data - CodeAlpha Internship Task

## 📌 Objective
This project was completed as part of my one-month remote internship at CodeAlpha. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can **predict the likelihood of a disease** based on medical data inputs.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering on medical records
- Training and comparison of multiple classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Performance evaluation using accuracy scores and confusion matrices
- Visual comparison of model performance
- Final selection of the best-performing model

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- MLxtend
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

## 📁 Files
- `codealpha-task-4.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full code and analysis
- `requirements.txt` – All Python dependencies

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter or Google Colab
4. Run all cells to train models and view predictions
