# 👨‍💻 Machine Learning Internship Projects – CodeAlpha

This repository contains three machine learning projects completed during my **One-Month Remote Internship at CodeAlpha**. Each project applies machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems, including credit scoring, disease prediction, and handwritten character recognition.

## 📚 Projects Overview

### 1. 🏦 Credit Scoring Model
**Objective**: Predict the creditworthiness of individuals using historical financial data.

- Used feature engineering and class balancing (SMOTE)
- Trained a `CatBoostClassifier` with hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV`
- Evaluated using accuracy score and classification report

### 2. 🧬 Disease Prediction from Medical Data
**Objective**: Predict the likelihood of a disease based on patient health records.

- Trained and compared multiple classification models:
  - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrices
- Selected the best-performing model

### 3. ✍️ Handwritten Character Recognition
**Objective**: Build a neural network to recognize handwritten characters (MNIST-style dataset).

- Preprocessed and normalized image data
- Built a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras
- Tuned hidden layer sizes and learning rates using `ParameterGrid`
- Visualized predictions and model accuracy
